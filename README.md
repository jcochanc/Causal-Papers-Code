## Literature

### Bayesian A/B Testing at VWO
- https://vwo.com/downloads/VWO_SmartStats_technical_whitepaper.pdf

Idea: A white paper that discusses an idea I’ve been mulling over. 

### Difference-in-Differences with multiple time periods
- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304407620303948
- https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09015

Discussion: 
- https://bcallaway11.github.io/did/articles/multi-period-did.html

### Efficient Estimation for Staggered Rollout Designs
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01291

### The stepped wedge cluster randomised trial: rationale, design, analysis, and reporting
- http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/BMJ.h391

Thoughts: The RCT of staggered DiD. 

### Extensible Experimentation Platform: Effective A/B Test Analysis at Scale
- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/388630852_Extensible_Experimentation_Platform_Effective_AB_Test_Analysis_at_Scale

Idea: A/B testing at scale: 100,000 experiments/year are now run at Microsoft based on a new paper to appear in ICSA 2025.

### Difference-in-Differences Designs: A Practitioner’s Guide
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13323

### Marketing RCTs etc
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.07055

Thoughts: Interesting paper on varying approaches in marketing. Probably the strength of this paper is the comparison of multiple methods and the “meta-analysis” being done. Their work shows the effect is over estimated by DML and SPSM.

### RieszBoost: Gradient Boosting for Riesz Regression

- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04871

Idea: New paper on estimating treatment function using gradient boosting. Helpful in high dimensional settings. 

### A/B Testing Intuition Busters
- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oK2HpKKXeQLX6gQeQpfEaCGZtNr2kR76/view

### DiD Resources

- https://psantanna.com/did-resources/

### ProRCA: A Causal Python Package for Root Cause Analysis 
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01475

Thoughts: Not a fan of Pearlean Causal Inference. We can talk about how the counterfactuals DoCalculus use are not realistic. But aside from that, a great way to begin merging the ideas of RCA and causal.
### Nonparametric causal decomposition of group disparities

- https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-statistics/volume-19/issue-1/Nonparametric-causal-decomposition-of-group-disparities/10.1214/24-AOAS1990.full

- https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5131050

### Causal Bayesian Optimization with Unknown Causal Graphs
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19554

### Why Propensity Scores Should Not Be Used for Matching
- https://gking.harvard.edu/sites/scholar.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/pan1900011_rev.pdf

### DOES REGRESSION PRODUCE REPRESENTATIVE CAUSAL RANKINGS?
- https://apoorvalal.github.io/pdfhosting/pdf/regrank.pdf

### Causal Inference and Uplift Modeling: A review of the literature
- https://proceedings.mlr.press/v67/gutierrez17a/gutierrez17a.pdf

### CATE and ITE Under Ignorability Assumptions
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.04939

### Copula-based Sensitivity Analysis for Multi-Treatment Causal Inference with Unobserved Confounding
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09412
